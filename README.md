# week 1 project for Garbage_classification
📘 Project Overview – AI/ML-Based Garbage Classification
In this AI & ML project, we developed a deep learning model to automatically classify garbage images into six key categories: Plastic, Metal, Paper, Cardboard, Glass, and Trash. The goal was to support smart waste management by enabling automated and accurate waste segregation using computer vision techniques.

We used EfficientNetV2B2, a powerful and efficient convolutional neural network, as the base model through transfer learning. The model was pretrained on ImageNet and fine-tuned on our custom dataset of garbage images.

🔧 Key Highlights:
Data Preprocessing: Images were resized, normalized, and augmented to handle class imbalance and improve model generalization.

Model Design: EfficientNetV2B2 with custom classification layers for the six waste categories.

Training Techniques: Used Adam optimizer, early stopping, and learning rate scheduling for efficient training.

Evaluation: Performance validated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

The final model achieved high accuracy in classifying waste into the specified categories and can be used in real-time systems for smart bins or waste sorting stations. This project demonstrates how AI can contribute to sustainable development by improving efficiency in recycling and waste management.
